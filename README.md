# MagnoScrape
This was a project to scrape together a bunch of weather and demographic data.

General look and feel

1. Get all weather station id's (webform)
2. Scrape a year of weather data, download year chunks of data per weather station
3. Parse and add into SQL db
4. Parse demographics data,
4a. lookup in google api for lat/long data to match with weather data
5. Add to SQL db and link id's with the weather data

Other scripts were made for data visualisation. Mainly a video timelapse of all canadian cities who need block heaters
